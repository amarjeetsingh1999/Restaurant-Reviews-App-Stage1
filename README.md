# Restaurant Review App Stage 1
===============================

## About
A static webpage was incrementally converted to a mobile-ready web application. A static design was taken that lacks accessibility and was converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker was also added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## How to Run the App
1. Open it online at this [link](https://amarjeetsingh1999.github.io/Restaurant-Reviews-App-Stage1/).
2. Run it locally
* Download this repository as .zip or clone this repository:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/amarjeetsingh1999/Restaurant-Reviews-App-Stage1.git
    ```
* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
